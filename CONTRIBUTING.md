## Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository**

> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/learn-hunger/visual-gestures.git
> cd visual-gestures
> ```

**2. Install the dependencies of source and examples**

> ```bash
> npm install
> cd example
> npm install
> ```

**3. Link the source code to example**

> ```bash
> cd ../
> npm run clone
> ```

**4. Run the example**

> ```bash
> cd example
> npm run dev
> ```

By default the webpage runs using this hostname [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)<br/><br/>
**6. [Debuging Panel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MmnZ9IVeZ5S004y1gVhQKTHF6z-mhCuw/view?usp=drive_link)**<br/>
Various debugging tools are placed under one interface for smooth development, quick troubleshooting, and inference, which includes:

1. Performance Monitors
2. Debug UI
3. Graphical Visualization(s)
4. Custom Landmarks Drawing. Know more about it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@learn-hunger/visualise-data-kit)

> You can view the Live Panel [here](https://visual-gestures.vercel.app/#debug)<br/>
> You can view in local by adding "#debug" path to host i.e., using the url [http://localhost:5173/#debug](http://localhost:5173/#debug) <br/>

**5. To Contribute ie raise pull request or creating branches etc** <br/>

Before raising a pull request, ensure that all automated code review features are enabled locally by executing the following statement, which include:

1. automatic formatting,
2. code guideline enforcement [Click to view demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SHbX5pwxlU7bOCKYaKQsChBro3_TENQv/view?usp=drive_link),
3. branch naming restrictions [Click to view demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BI_LNioRfmd7dGk1F4kAY5B51OsoEo68/view?usp=drive_link), and
4. commit message naming rules [Click to view demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BI_LNioRfmd7dGk1F4kAY5B51OsoEo68/view?usp=drive_link).
   Verify that these checks are in place before pushing the code to the remote repository.

   > ```bash
   > npm run config
   > ```

## Architecture

For new contributors or collaborators, understanding the code can be challenging. To facilitate smoother development, we create UML diagrams for every development task.

You can view the architecture via

## Future Scope

As we continue to refine our system, future improvements will focus on enhancing algorithmic precision for more accurate gesture recognition in diverse environments, including low-light conditions and faster gestures, ensuring a more robust and responsive interaction experience.
